                        <h3>Overview</h3>
                        <p>Many organizations have multiple committees that are responsible for different aspects of their operations, such as finance, audit, and governance. However, <span>managing these committees can be challenging and time-consuming</span>, particularly if there are multiple members and a large volume of documents to track.</p>
                        <h3>Context</h3>
                        <p>There are <span> two different interfaces &nbsp;</span>that this product will impact. One is the web interface designed for board professionals that organize committees and the other is customer facing website and app for board and committee members. This meant working with two different design patterns while keeping in mind that the design will impact two different user groups.</p>
                        <h3>Stakeholders</h3>
                        <p>For this project, I had to continuously communicate with my stakeholders to update them on my progress as well as be proactive in seeking out feedback. I worked closely with my product manager Gavin Guest . I checked in with software engineers TJ Coyle, CL Lewis and Matt Hicks for engineering feedback to <span>
                        identify any limitations or restrictions and proposed solutions to any roadblocks

                <p>Action items such as tasks, eSignatures, surveys and votes  play crucial roles alongside a meeting to enhance decision making, collaboration, and efficiency. Unfortunately, these items existed more as silos and not in continuance with the meeting structure. This is something I wanted to avoid moving forward.</p>

                        <h3>Competitive Analysis</h3>
                        <p>Other board management software platforms like Diligent Boards, BoardEffect, Onboard etc. all have committee management functionality built in. While the specific features and capabilities may vary, they generally allow users to <span>
                            create and manage committees, schedule meetings, assign tasks, and collaborate on committee-related documents and materials.
                        </span> </p>
                        <h3>Constraints and Scope</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>User adoption: Our users are not tech-savvy so introducing completely new design patterns would be challenging. For this reason, we adopted existing UI and modified it to fit our featureâ€™s needs.
</li>
                            <li>Cost: Cost is another potential constraint to consider. If the Committees feature requires additional resources, such as hardware or software, it may be cost-prohibitive for some organizations.
</li>
                            <li>Data security: Data security is a critical constraint to consider, particularly for sensitive information such as committee documents and meeting minutes. The Committees feature must ensure that data is stored and transmitted securely to protect against data breaches and other security risks.
</li>
                            <li>Governance: Committee charters vary depending on committees and company size. Moreover, every organization has multiple committees which are all governed in different ways. This would limit any automatic systems that we would want to place within the design.
</li>
                            <li>Technical limitations: Finally, there may be technical limitations to consider, such as limitations in the platform's ability to handle large files or support real-time collaboration. These limitations could impact the effectiveness of the Committees feature and limit its functionality.</li>

                        <h3>Why</h3>
                        <p>Larger organizations may have a complicated committee structure that includes parent-child relationships between committees. The more complex your organization is, the more important it is to track and maintain these relationships to help improve organizational clarity.</p>
                        <h3>How</h3>
                        <p>Board professionals with this feature may create parent-child relationships between any number of committees regardless of type. Govenda creates a straightforward relationship between these groups; these relationships do not affect any other functionality in the system.</p>
                        <h3>Solution</h3>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Adding/Removing Children: After selecting a group, users may add or remove children in bulk. You may re-assign children to another parent, or leave them without a parent.

</li>
                            <li>Changing Parents: After selecting a group users may change the parent group of the currently selected committee or remove it's parent. Changing the parent of a group does not affect that groups children or grandchildren in any way. There is no direct relationship between "grandparent" and "grandchildren" in Govenda.
</li>

                        <p>
                        At many organizations, board or committee charters specify how long a member may remain in a position on that board or committee. It falls on the office of the Corp. Sec. to enforce these limits. Govenda's tenure tracking tools help companies ensure compliance with their own rules.
                        </p>
                        <h3>How</h3>
                        <p>For any member of a committee, board professionals may add one or more roles for that user. For each role, a start and/or end date may be defined. Setting these dates will being tracking the total amount of time that this user has been in this role. Adding an end date will show this user on the Tenure Tracking report (analytics).</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>After the introduction of our AI tool, we were able to automate the use of committee charters in creation of a committee. This did not require building user flows since the AI tool was able to coomplete initial set up using the charters which decreased the time that board professional spent on organizing committees.</li>
                    <li>We also introduced a visual hierarchy chart so that board professionals were easily able to view the hierarchy and make business decisions.</li>
                    
                </ul>
                <p>Overall, designing and working on this tool was one of the highlights of my career because I learned so much. It is always surreal seeing designs come to life especially in the form of a stand alone product. I couldnâ€™t have done this without the excellent team at Govenda.</p>
